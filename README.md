TAPPY
-----

TAPPY is a tidal analysis package. It breaks down an hourly record of water
levels into the component sine waves. It is written in Python and uses the
least squares optimization and other functions in SciPy. The focus is to make
the most accurate analysis possible. TAPPY only determines the constituents
that are calculatable according to the length of the time series.

I (Pierre Cazenave) have made minor changes to the code to allow TAPPY to be used as a module in scripts.
